Got it! Thanks for the clarification 🙌

Since you're learning Git and DVC through this repo and following an example (maybe from a YouTube tutorial), your `README.md` should reflect that it's a **learning/practice project**, not a full production-grade implementation.

Here's a **simplified and more appropriate README section** tailored for your use case:

---

## 📘 YT-MLOPS-DVC-DataVersion

This repository is part of my **learning journey** into **MLOps** concepts, focusing specifically on **Data Versioning using DVC (Data Version Control)**. I'm following along with example tutorials (e.g., YouTube or blogs) to understand how to use DVC in machine learning workflows.

---

### 🎯 Goal of This Repo

* Practice using **Git** for version control
* Learn how **DVC** tracks and versions datasets
* Understand how to:

  * Add and manage datasets using `dvc add`
  * Track data without storing it in Git
  * Use `.dvc` files to manage large files
  * Push/pull data from remote storage (if configured)

---

### 🔧 Tools & Concepts

* **Git** – for tracking code
* **DVC** – for tracking data and pipelines
* **Python** – basic scripts (optional, depending on the example)

---


### 🧪 What I Learned So Far

* How to initialize DVC in a Git repo:

  ```bash
  dvc init
  ```

* How to add a file to DVC tracking:

  ```bash
  dvc add data/sample.csv
  git add data/sample.csv.dvc .gitignore
  git commit -m "Track data file with DVC"
  ```

* How to set up and use remote storage (optional):

  ```bash
  dvc remote add -d myremote <remote-url>
  dvc push
  ```

---

### 📚 Resources I'm Following

* YouTube: *\[The Ultimate MLOPS Course by Vikas Das]*
* DVC Docs: [https://dvc.org/doc](https://dvc.org/doc)

---

### 📝 Note

This repo is not a production project. It's for **educational purposes only** as I explore Git + DVC tools and MLOps best practices.
